When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Remote repositirys can be used when you want to share your work publicly to 
    colaborate or get help and advice.
    Remote repositorys are also a usfull place to stor work as a back up.  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manual pull alows the user to determain what and when to pull 
    commits made to GitHub. If this was automatic, you may end up 
    with stuff you dont want. The same gose fo push. Manual alows users to determain when and what commits to push to GitHub. i.e. what infomation to share.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches are created within the logical progrsttion of commits.
    The can be used to make changes to files without affecting the master.

    Clones are copies of repositiorys. You can clone a repo localy or 
    from GitHub. Colnes from GitHub to local are likned via remote.
    
    Forks are copies of repositorys on GitHub. You can fork a repository
    to get a copy of it onto your GitHub profile. Forked repositorys 
    are not conected via remote.
